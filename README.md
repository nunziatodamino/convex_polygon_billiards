# Convex Polygon Billiards

---

**Convex Polygon Billiards** is a C++ simulation project that models the motion of particles within a convex polygonal boundary using reflective boundary conditions. 
Particles are initialized randomically inside the polygon and their velocity is assigned using a uniform distribution between 2 limiting symmetrical values.
Also the particles radiuses are assigned using a uniform distribution between 2 limiting values.

The user can at the start of the simulation chooses the (regular) polygon by selecting the number of sides and also chooses the particle number to be initialized inside the polygon.

Graphics is handled via the Raylib library.

## Build process

The process can be build with Cmake.
