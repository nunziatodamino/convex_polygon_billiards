# Convex Polygon Billiards

**Convex Polygon Billiards** is a C++ simulation project that models the motion of particles within a convex polygonal boundary using reflective (billiard-style) boundary conditions. The simulation is designed to be interactive and modular, allowing for experimentation with different polygon shapes and particle counts.

---

## üìê Project Overview

The simulation operates in two phases:

1. **Initialization**
   - User selects the number of sides `N` (3 ‚â§ N ‚â§ 12).
   - A convex polygon with `N` vertices is generated (initially regular).
   - User selects the number of particles `M` (1 ‚â§ M ‚â§ 100).
   - Particles are initialized with random positions inside the polygon and random velocities.

2. **Simulation**
   - Particles move linearly within the polygon.
   - When a particle hits a polygon edge, it reflects according to the law of reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection).
   - Simulation steps are updated over time, possibly visualized with a graphics library (TBD).

## üß± Key Components (Planned)

### 1. `Polygon` Class
- Stores vertices of the polygon
- Provides methods for:
  - Edge detection
  - Point-in-polygon checks
  - Computing reflection normals

### 2. `Particle` Class
- Position (`x, y`)
- Velocity vector (`vx, vy`)
- Update method to compute motion
- Collision handling with polygon edges

### 3. `Simulation` Class
- Manages the list of particles and polygon
- Handles the main loop:
  - Position updates
  - Collision checks
  - Time stepping

## üéÆ User Input

```
Enter number of polygon sides (3‚Äì12): 7
Enter number of particles (1‚Äì100): 25
```

Initial conditions are generated and the simulation begins.

## üß™ Implementation Notes

- Initial polygon is regular (equal side lengths and angles)
- Particles start with random direction and fixed speed
- Reflective boundaries follow geometric laws (mirror-like reflection)
- Time-stepping uses a fixed delta `dt`

---

## üé® Visualization (Optional / Planned)

- Use SFML, SDL2, or OpenGL for 2D rendering
- Display particle trails
- Color particles by velocity or time

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Build System

- CMake-based build setup (recommended)
- Standard C++17 or newer
- Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS)

---

## üöß Future Design Considerations

- Support for arbitrary convex polygons (non-regular)
- Particle-particle collisions
- Exporting trajectories to file
- Real-time controls (pause, speed up, reset)
